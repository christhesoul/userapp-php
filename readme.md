Without wanting to be too much of self-deprecating wally, I'm not a great developer, so any constructive feedback is very welcome.

Dependencies
============

I'm using UniRest (a lightweight HTTP request library). This dependency is referenced in the composer.json file, so if you have Composer (http://getcomposer.org/) installed, then I think you can just run `composer install` when inside this directory.
